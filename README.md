## Predicting_epileptic_seizure_using_SQL_and_Weka

This study is about the classification and detection of epileptic seizure using the Electroencephalogram (EEG) time series dataset. An EEG time series, particularly those of short duration, can carry enough information to reveal dynamic properties of the underlying system brain. This study however, compares dynamical properties of brains electrical activity from different recording regions and different physiological and pathological brain states. The dataset is collected from five different sets and merged together with the help of SQL tools in the form suitable for the machine learning tools such as Weka. Data is converged in a way such that the resultant contains all the independent and dependent variables for classification learning. In this study, models are created on the training dataset and later concluded on which models performs the best detection of the epileptic seizure on the time series dataset using some significant measures of accuracy.
